### Guice 
----
Guice is a lighweight java framework used for dependency injection.
____
This repo is a reflection of my learning and testing journey of this framework.

Each folder in here is a project on its own, with Main file being commented out to avoid any accidental runs.

Each folder can be run with `gradle run`, or by importing it in eclipse, as the `build.gradle` file contains the `id 'eclipse'` plugin.
